# üîß Kerberos DIY üè∑Ô∏è
An imitation of the network-identification, ticket-based **Kerberos** protocol in a Java suite, from login within the secure client machine to interaction with the selected service once the protocol is completed.

## Preface üìù
This project was created solely for academic purposes. Specifically, to gain some practical experience with concepts otherwise seen only on a theoretical level (hash functions, key creation, encryption/decryption, ...).
As such, several of the choices made wouldn't be optimal for a non-sandbox environment. Take it as a way to visualise the Kerberos protocol step-by-step, or as an instrument to teach others.

### Entities Visual Representation üñºÔ∏è
In the following picture:
* `TGS` stands for Ticket-Gating Server
* `T1, T2, ...` are timestamps while `DT2, DT3, ...` are the deltas after which the response is deemed invalid and the protocol must restart
* `psw` is a key derived from the password of the user
* `K_TGS_C` or `TGS_C_K` is the first session key, used between the Client and the Selected TGS to communicate safely
* `KTGS` is a secret key shared between the Authentication Server and a specific TGS exclusively
* `K_S_C` or `S_C_K` is the second session key, used between the Client and the requested Service to communicate safely


‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, there is only 1 functional Realm and 1 functional Service belonging to said realm. Those are `R1` and `luckyNumbers` respectively.
